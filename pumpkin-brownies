    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>¾ cup all-purpose flour </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon baking powder </li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>
        <li>¾ cup butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups white sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>
        <li>3 eggs</li>
        <li>¼ cup cocoa powder</li>
        <li>½ cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>
        <li>½ cup pumpkin puree</li>
        <li>½ cup chopped walnuts</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground cloves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground nutmeg</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
        Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x8 inch baking pan. Stir the flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl.
        </li>
        <li>
        In another bowl, stir together the melted butter, sugar, and vanilla extract; beat in the eggs one at a time with a spoon. Gradually add the flour mixture, and stir the batter until it's evenly moistened. Divide the batter in half in two separate bowls.
        </li>
        <li>
        Into one bowl of batter, blend the cocoa powder and chocolate chips. In the second bowl of batter, stir in the pumpkin puree, walnuts, cinnamon, cloves, and nutmeg.
        </li>
        <li>
        Spread 1/2 of the chocolate batter into the bottom of the prepared baking pan, and follow with 1/2 of the pumpkin batter. Repeat the layers, ending with a pumpkin layer, and drag a kitchen knife or small spatula gently through the layers in a swirling motion, to create a marbled appearance.
        </li>
        <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven until the brownies begin to pull away from the sides of the pan, and a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 40 to 45 minutes. Cool in the pan, cut into squares, and serve.
